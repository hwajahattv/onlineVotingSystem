<h1>Online Voting System (Web + Mobile app) â€” Laravel | JQuery</h1>
This is a freelance project about the online voting system. I am responsible for the web development part of the project. This has an auth system with email verification before logging in. There is admin dashboard, who can add candidates and voters to the system. The voters can self register themselves through public access portal. The web frontend and backend is designed in Laravel and MySQL database is used. The mobile application is used to take finger prints of the voters to recognise their identity.
